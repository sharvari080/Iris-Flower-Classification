# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species – *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* – based on their measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). This is a fundamental supervised learning task where the aim is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify a flower species based on its physical characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains measurements of iris flowers across three species. The dataset can be downloaded from [link to the dataset] or can be accessed through Scikit-learn's built-in datasets.

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species**

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset file.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models for future use.
- **images/**: Visualizations generated from the data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists required packages for the project.
- **main.py**: Python script to train and evaluate the classification model.
